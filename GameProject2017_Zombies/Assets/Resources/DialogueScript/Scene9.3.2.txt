;I waited for hours and hours for someone to appear but no one came.;0;L
 ;I looked outside and saw the darkening sky. The dark clouds started to gather together, engulfing the light that shines upon the town as the clouds moved towards each other.;0;L
 ;The sunlight barely shines through the thickened cloud as the first rainfall fell upon the window I was looking through.;0;L
 ;A shower of rainfall followed suit. I had a bad feeling about this, but I had to stay calm.;0;L

 ;Suddenly I spotted someone running through the rain and into the house.;0;L
 ;I couldn't see his face because of the rainfall. It got me nervous. I wasn't sure who it was it could be anyone.;0;L
 ;I quietly put my brother down from my lap and stood up.;0;L
 ;As I slowly walked to the door I took out my gun that was holstered on my waist.;0;L
 ;I locked the door and listened to the sound of footsteps that slowly encroach forward.;0;L
 ;My heart started racing as the footsteps got closer.;0;L
 ;The footstep stopped. The person I saw was in front of the door.;0;L
 ;I checked if my gun was off safety and slowly wrapped my hands onto the door knob.;0;L
 ;I turned my hands and quickly pushed the door wide open. I pointed my gun straight onto the door.;0;L
Emily;Ouch! Why did you have to push it Acel?;2;L
Acel;Is that you Emily?;3;R
Emily;Yes it's me why did you have to push the door so hard?;2;L

Emily;Still you didn't have to push it so hard. Ow...;2;L
 ;I helped her up.;0;L
 ;(SoundEffect of trucks rolling up);0;L
 ;I signaled Emily to be quiet and walked towards the window.;0;L
 ;I looked out and saw a platoon of soldiers surrounding the house.;0;L
Acel;Damn its the Military Police.;2;R
 ;I looked back and saw that she wasn't surprised at all, but instead she looked nervous.;0;L
 ;I have a bad feeling about this.;0;L
Acel;Emily?;3;R
 ;She didn't reply but instead pulled a gun from her ankle.;0;L
Acel;Emily! What are you doing?;3;R
Emily;I'm sorry Acel. Please just don't do anything stupid.;2;L

 ; While I was walking towards the brick house I notice something was off the door was left open.;0;L
 ; Wait. Who would leave the door this open? And where is the look out that was standing next to the door.;0;L
 ; Left puzzled I slowly approach the door. Step by step I started to get more anxious cause the atmosphere is too quiet. I could hear only the sound of winds blowing past behind me.;0;L
 ;As I approach the door I was thinking to myself did something happen? Or was it just a careless person? But no one is this careless I've gotta be alert;0;L
 ; When i reach the door I slowly peak inside. Nothing out in the ordinary but I couldn't really see inside. So I walked inside to get a better view.;0;L
